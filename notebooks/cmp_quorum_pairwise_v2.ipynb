    "1. Q+T has less alignment than Pairwise.  Even if the expertise is normalized, it is less b/c\n",
    "   the user must also assign funding amounts to each project.  This introduces an additional source\n",
    "   of randomness.\n",
    "2. Even if it is not random (i.e. top ranked project gets top amount and then work down), all badgeholder's views are aggregated and this introduces some noise in the alignment.\n",
    "3. Interestingly, as badgeholder laziness goes up in the Q+T scheme, the alignment seems to get better. Likely b/c they vote on less projects, so there is less ambiguity in assigning projects closer amounts of funding, causing\n",
    "4. It really depends on how a Q+T badgeholder assigns funding to the projects after they have ranked them.\n",
    "5. This means the above plot may not be completely fair in terms of comparison, in the sense that pairwise is comparing alignment directly, where as Q+T is including the scoring aspect.  That being said, that is sort of the mechanism, since in pairwise, we only want rankings and then we create an a-priori mapping to funding amount, so this is sort of an advantage in the sense that it creates a clearer signal.\n"
